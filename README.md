# SuperTux Classic
This is the code for the study "Analyzing the Impact of Frametime Spikes on Navigation-Based Tasks in 2D Platformers."

The code for the original SuperTux Classic can be found at https://github.com/Alzter/SuperTux-Classic

# Running the Study
Download Godot 3.5.2 from https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.5.2-stable/

Run Godot and open the project (if it's your first time opening it, you'll have to click "Import").

After running the game, select "Frame Stutter" from the menu.

# Known Issues
- The user ID does not properly increment if SuperTux Classic is run as a standalone executable. To get around this, run SuperTux Classic from the engine.
